= Jozi JUG AWS sample application =

== Setup JBoss ==
Start JBoss AS 7.1+

Fix the slf4j module, by editing ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/org/jboss/logging/main/module.xml and add those two to the dependencies:

    <module name="org.apache.log4j"/>
    <module name="org.slf4j"/>

'' This might be fixed by JBoss one day, but still for JBoss AS 7.1-Final does not work properly''
